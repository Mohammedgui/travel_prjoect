</div>
<div class="sphere">
    <p>Warehouses are critical components of the supply chain, serving as storage facilities for goods before they reach retailers or customers. They facilitate inventory management, allowing businesses to hold stock and respond to demand fluctuations efficiently.

        Equipped with advanced technology, modern warehouses often include automated systems for tracking inventory and streamlining operations. This enhances accuracy and reduces labor costs, making the process more efficient.
        
        Different types of warehouses, such as distribution centers, cold storage, and fulfillment centers, cater to specific needs, from perishable goods to e-commerce logistics.
        
        The strategic location of a warehouse can significantly impact shipping times and costs, highlighting the importance of site selection in logistics planning.
        
        Overall, warehouses play a vital role in ensuring that products are available when and where they are needed, underpinning the functionality of the global economy.</p>
